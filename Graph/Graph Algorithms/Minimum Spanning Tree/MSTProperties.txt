1. Removing one edge from the ST will make it disconnected.
2. Adding one edge to the ST will create a cycle (loop).
3. If each edge has a distinct weight, there will be only one unique MST.
4. A complete undirected graph can have 2^n−2 distinct spanning trees.
5. Every connected and undirected graph has at least one Spanning Tree.
6. A disconnected graph does not have any Spanning Tree.
7. From a complete graph, by removing e−n+1 edges, we can construct a Spanning Tree.
