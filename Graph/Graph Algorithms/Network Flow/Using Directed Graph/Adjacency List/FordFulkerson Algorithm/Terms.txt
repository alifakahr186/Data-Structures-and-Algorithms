Ford-Fulkerson
We can implemented both of BFS or DFS.

Basic Terms:
1: Source
2: Sink
3: Capacity and Bottleneck Capacity
4: Flow
5: Augumenting Path
6: Residual Capacity

1:Source
The Source vertex has all outward edge, no inward edge

2:Sink
Sink will have all inward edge, no outward edge

3:Bottleneck Capacity
Bottleneck Capacity of the path is the minimum capacity of any edge on the path

4: Flow
Point: we write flow and capacity: flow/capacity 4/5

5: Augumenting Path
We find Bottleneck capacity of nodes from Source to Sink than that thing is called Augumenting Path

6: Residual Capacity
Every edge of a Residual graph(A graph which represents Network Flow) has a value called Residual capacity
which is equal to orginal capacity minus currect flow. The path which Residual capacity zero.
We should not consider that.
Residual value = 4/5, 4 - 5, 1, 1/5
New Residual value = min+4/5
