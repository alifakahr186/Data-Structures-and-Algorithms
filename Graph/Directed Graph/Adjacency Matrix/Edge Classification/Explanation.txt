TREE EDGE
An edge (x, y) is a tree edge if y is discovered for the first time while exploring x in DFS.

FORWARD EDGE
An edge (x, y) is a forward edge if y appears after x in the DFS traversal, meaning y is 
already visited, and there is a path from x to y.

BACKWARD EDGE
An edge (x, y) is a backward edge if y appears before x in the DFS traversal, meaning y is 
an ancestor of x, creating a cycle.

CROSS EDGE
1. (x, y) where no path from y to x.
2. An edge (x, y) is a cross edge if y is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of x, meaning 
    x and y belong to different DFS trees (in a disconnected graph or different components).

NOTE: Where x & y are Vertex
