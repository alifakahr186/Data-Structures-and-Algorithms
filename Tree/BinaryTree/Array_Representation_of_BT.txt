CASE I:
    1. If a node is at ith index:
        Left child would be at [(2*i)+1]
        Right child would be at [(2*i)+2]
        Parent would be at [(i-1)/2]

CASE II:
    2. Node is at ith index:
        Left child at = (2*i)
        Right child at = [(2*i)+1]
        Parent at = [i/2]
