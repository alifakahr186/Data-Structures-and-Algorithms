Top-Down Deletion: 
In this approach, you start from the root and traverse the tree 
to find the node you want to delete. While traversing
you splay the tree as needed to bring the node to be deleted 
closer to the root. Once you find the node
you perform the deletion operation. This approach involves splaying 
the tree during the search process and then performing the deletion.

First make a delete node as a root by performing splaying
then delete root and then apply join operation on it.
Find maximum from left and then make that node a root node
and then attached right to that root node OR 
Find minimum from right and then make that node a root node
and then attached left to that root node.
