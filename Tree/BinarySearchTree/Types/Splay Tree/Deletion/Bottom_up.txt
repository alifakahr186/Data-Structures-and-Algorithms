Bottom-Up Deletion: 

Here, you first find the node you want to delete according to BST.
Once found, you remove the node and then splay the parent of the deleted node. 
This splaying operation moves the parent node closer to the root, 
adjusting the tree structure to maintain the splaying property.

FOR INTERNAL NODE.
You can not delete internal node, for deleting internal
node first replace it with inorder predecessor or successor
then perform splay on parent (a node which you delete) if parent is 
already root node then do not need of splay.
