Step 1: If tree is empty, create newnode as root node with color BLACK.

Step 2: If tree is not empty, create newnode as leaf node with color RED.

Step 3: If parent of newnode is BLACK then exit.

Step 4: If parent of newnode is RED then check the color of parent sibling of newnode:

    a: If color is BLACK or NULL then do suitable rotation(Do AVL) and recolor.
    
    b: If color is RED then recolor and also check if parent's parent of newnode is not root node
        then recolor it and recheck

What is suitable rotation?
