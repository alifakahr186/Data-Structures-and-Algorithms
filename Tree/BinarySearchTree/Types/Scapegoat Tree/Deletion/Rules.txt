1. If the node to be deleted is a leaf node (has no children), simply remove it.
2. If the node to be deleted has one child, replace it with its child.
3. If the node to be deleted has two children, find the in-order successor
4. Update the Heights and Sizes of Ancestor Nodes
    i: After deletion, update the height and size of all ancestor nodes
5. Check for Balance After Deletion
    i: Size of left subtree≤α×Size of the whole subtree
6. Identify the Scapegoat Node if the Tree is Unbalanced
7. Rebuild the Subtree Rooted at the Scapegoat
    i: In-order Traversal
    ii: Balanced Reconstruction
8. Reconnect the Rebalanced Subtree:
