# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository  

This repository is designed for **beginners** who are starting their journey with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It covers all the **basic topics** in DSA and gradually moves towards **advanced concepts**.

## Structure and Guidelines  

### Beginner-Friendly  
- The repository starts with **basic concepts** and gradually progresses to more advanced topics.
- If you are a beginner, you can completely follow this repository to build a **strong foundation** in DSA.  
- All beginner and intermediate topics are complete and ready to practice.

## Contribution Guidelines  

To maintain consistency and quality, please follow these rules before contributing:  

1. **Allowed Language**:  
   - Only **C++** is allowed in this repository.  

2. **Coding Style**:  
   - Match the formatting and coding patterns already used in this repository.  
   - Use **simple, standard C++ formatting** (avoid shorthand / one-liners / tricky code that reduces readability).  
   - Properly **comment your code** where it needed.

3. **File/Folder Naming Convention**:  
   - Follow the existing naming system.  
   - Place your code inside the appropriate directory.  

4. **Scope of Contribution**:  
   - You can only add/improve solutions for the **basic data structures** already present.  
   - If you feel that a **particular DSA file** can be enhanced with **new features or additional variations**, you should add them in the same file/directory.  
   - Do not add advanced algorithms here â€” use the dedicated repo: [Advanced-DSA](https://github.com/alifakahr186/Advanced-DSA).  

5. **Issue Reporting**:  
   - If you find any problem or inaccurate solution, **create an issue** first.  
   - Clearly mention the problem and possible fix.  
   - Wait for review and approval before making a pull request.
