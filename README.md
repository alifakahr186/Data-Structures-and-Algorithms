This repository is designed for beginners who are starting their journey with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It covers all the basic topics in DSA and gradually moves towards advanced concepts.

# Structure and Guidelines
### 1. Beginner-Friendly
The repository starts with basic concepts and gradually progresses to more advanced topics, making it suitable for learners at all stages.
### 2.Language Flexibility
- The repository is primarily implemented in C++.
- If you prefer to implement the DSA topics in a different programming language, feel free to modify the specific file for that language. However, ensure that the main title and structure 
  of the DSA topics remain the same to maintain consistency.

## For Beginners Programmers
- If you are a beginner, you can completely follow this repository to build a strong foundation in DSA and progress towards advanced concepts.
- Some advanced DSA topics are still incomplete, but the repository is fully complete for beginners and intermediate-level learners.

## For Advanced Programmers
If you are an experienced programmer, some sections may be incomplete for you. You are welcome to contribute and improve this repository following the contribution rules mentioned below.

# Contribution Guidelines
- You can write solutions in C++/C#/Python.
- Follow provided C++ coding style or any other C#/Python when contributing code. The structure and pattern of the code must remain consistent.
- Follow the file/folder naming convention for all your pull requests.
- While adding any content it should be inside its appropriate directory
- You can only make improvements or add enhancements to the basic Data Structures already present.
- If you want to add advanced algorithms, a separate repository has been created for them. [Click here](https://github.com/alifakahr186/Advanced-DSA) to check it out.
- If there is any problem with an inaccurate solution create an issue! Wait for review and approval.
